## Data Source

The data that we use for our analyses can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/rit-public/HappyDB/tree/master/happydb/data). The description of the variables in each one of those data files can be found [here](https://github.com/rit-public/HappyDB).

In particular, we use the "cleaned_hm.csv" and "demographic.csv" for our project.
